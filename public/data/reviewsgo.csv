"Lynn Wagner","Apr 7, 2024",1,"It’s with a heavy heart that I write this review, because I know there is a need for this service & liked the owner when he initially came to our house. We had glass replaced in three sashes of wooden windows. The installer came and spent the day breaking each pane out, gouging the wood surrounding the panes, and leaving glue oozing out of all sides. After calling & sending photos to the office, they sent him back out to fix the problem. He spread a lot of putty on the wood & cut out the glue. The work looked like it had been done by a first grader. When I relayed our dissatisfaction to the owner, I hoped he’d come out to look. His response was that we were lucky that the installer had come out the second time, because their disclaimer says that they are not responsible for ‘cleanup’. Didn’t realize the cleanup meant half the job. I’ll end by saying that he told me that I had gotten his best installer, while the installer himself said he was the only one doing installations.

"Rick Johnson","May 22, 2023",5,"After exploring all kinds of options, quotes, and a previous window install that Window World botched, we went with Josh and his team at The Window Hospital. The process is actually pretty amazing and there's no upselling, pressure, etc. I had an odd schedule last week, but Josh checked every window, cataloged the measurements and annotated each sash that needed to be replaced. You're only buying what you need. He and his team returned a few days later (again, that was on me, it would have been same day) to do the installation. I have to give a shoot out to Tra and his kind engaging personality. He knocked out all the windows same day, and everything looked amazing. We encountered a minor hiccup in our casement window, but after looking at the hardware/tracks I just ordered a new set. Nothing that was their fault, just worn hinges. $60 to order two sets from Grainger, and after watching a YouTube video these were a breeze to install. I'm sure they would have switch them for me, but it was something I wanted to do. This was the absolute best decision to go this route. No vinyl capping, replacing only what was needed, matches perfectly to original windows, no siding removal, and no frame alignment problems, etc. etc. etc. The price is very affordable compared to replacement windows. Quick, affordable, professional, and the endresult is a house that we can finally enjoy our wonderful views. To appreciate the job, we had 38 total sashes replaced. Literally, every top sash and about half of the bottoms. Thanks Josh and Tra!! Positive: Responsiveness, Quality, Professionalism, Value",""

"Calvin Whitby","Oct 14, 2022",1,"Had an estimator come out on August 4 to measure and was told the replacement pane of glass wasn’t in stock and that it needed to be ordered and it would take 3 to 4 weeks for it to come in. It’s now almost mid October and not a word from this company. But no worries, I hired another company and the glass replacement will be done tomorrow. Thanks for the unprofessionalism, it’s greatly appreciated. I have to respond to the response given from this company regarding a 50% percent deposit. When the guy (don't know his name) completed measuring, I walked with him to the front of my home because he needed to point out another issue I had with a window located on the 3rd floor of my home, and before he left I asked him did he need any type of deposit since he had to order the glass. HE SAID NO! Negative: Responsiveness, Professionalism","The Window Hospital Inc., Owner, Oct 14, 2022: Thank you for the feedback, Calvin. I’m sorry to hear that you had to wait longer than expected for your sliding glass door panel. Our goal is always to get customers glass done as quickly as possible and we are always working to make our process even more efficient. Upon further investigation into this we found the deposit of 50% was never paid because it appears the invoice was never received. In hindsight we should’ve followed up with you once we didn’t hear anything back but we try to avoid a high-pressure sales experience and never want a customer to feel pressured. Since the invoice wasn’t sent/received we never ordered the customer tempered panel. - Josh (owner)"

Josh responded almost immediately and by lunch time he had already come by the house, removed and measured the old glass from the window to get proper measurements, gave me a solid quote and a date/time to be repaired. I was blown away after dealing with guys all over Richmond literally begging them to come fix my window, I even offered these other companies extra money and payment up front bc it was holding up the sale of my house. We agreed upon the following Tuesday as an install date and everything worked out perfect to the T.

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Yes, in 85% of cases, you can replace just the glass for $200-$600, saving you thousands over full window replacement costs of $1,000-$3,000+. Our professional glaziers at The Window Hospital Inc. handle this common repair, ensuring proper sealing for energy efficiency. If your frame is old or damaged, we'll advise if full replacement makes sense—but repairs are often the smarter choice."

    "name": "Can you replace just one side of the glass package?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "No, dual pane glass packages (IGUs) are sealed units filled with air for insulation. To maintain the seal, both panes must be replaced, whether one or both are broken. The cost remains the same, typically $200-$600, far less than the $1,000+ for a new window."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Probably not. On our first visit, we remove the window to measure the IGU, then reinstall it until the new glass is ready. Replacement takes under 10 minutes on the second visit. If broken glass worsens during measurement, leaving a partial or full hole, we replace it the next day. For temporary coverage, use cardboard or a trash bag—we keep it simple and cost-free for you."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "By texting us a picture of your window at 540-603-0088, our experts can assess its size, type (e.g., double-hung, 6-lite), and visible damage (e.g., cracks, fog). We use this to estimate repair costs—typically $200-$600—based on our experience with thousands of windows. For exact pricing, we confirm measurements on-site, but photos give us a reliable starting point."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "No, our IGUs are air-filled, not argon-filled. Argon is denser and marketed as a better insulator, but its benefits are overhyped—factory fill rates average 70%, leaking 10% yearly. Our air-filled units are proven, defect-free, and cost-effective, saving you money without the sales pitch."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Low-E (low emissivity) is a coating that reflects heat, keeping your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer. It boosts energy efficiency and cuts heating/cooling costs. Look for a greenish tint outside (with grids) or test with white paper inside—if it's greenish, you likely have Low-E."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Yes, choosing clear glass over Low-E can lower repair costs. Low-E improves efficiency, but clear glass still works well and saves money upfront. It won't match Low-E's tint, so it's your call if the difference bothers you—see our example photo of Low-E vs. clear."

    question: "Can I replace just the glass in my window?",
    answer: "Yes, replacing just the glass in your window is a common and affordable repair option. A professional glazier or handyman can handle this task efficiently. However, if the window frame is old or damaged, replacing the entire unit might be more cost-effective in the long run. Properly installed and sealed glass ensures energy efficiency and prevents air leaks, saving you money compared to a full replacement.",

    question: "Can you replace just one side of a dual-pane glass package?",
    answer: "No, dual-pane glass packages, also known as Insulated Glass Units (IGUs), are sealed units filled with air for insulation. If one pane breaks, both must be replaced to maintain the seal and insulation properties. Whether one or both panes are damaged, the cost remains the same due to the nature of the IGU assembly.",

    }
  },
  {
    question: "Will I have a hole in my house during the repair?",
    answer: "Typically, no. On our first visit, we remove the window to measure the IGU's height, width, and thickness, then reinstall it until the new glass is ready. During the second visit, we replace the old glass with the new one in under 10 minutes. If the glass is already broken and further damaged during measurement, a partial or full hole may occur temporarily. In such cases, we recommend using cardboard, paper bags, or a trash bag with tape as a low-cost cover until we return—usually the next day—avoiding extra charges for plastic sheeting."
  },
  {
    question: "How can you accurately price a window through messages using a picture?",
    answer: "We can provide an accurate estimate by analyzing a clear photo of your window, including its frame and dimensions. This allows us to assess the size, type of glass, and any specific requirements, ensuring a reliable quote for your glass repair or replacement needs.",

  {
    question: "Do your glass packages have argon?",
    answer: "No, our IGUs are air-filled rather than argon-filled. While argon is denser than air and marketed as a superior insulator, its benefits are often overstated. Factory-filled argon windows typically start at a 70% fill rate and lose about 10% annually, leading to eventual failure. Our air-filled IGUs are a proven, cost-effective solution, delivering defect-free performance for years without the hype."

  {
    question: "What is Low-E glass?",
    answer: "Low-E (low emissivity) glass has a thin coating that reflects thermal radiation, improving energy efficiency. It keeps heat inside during winter and blocks heat from entering in summer, reducing heating and cooling costs. If your window grids appear greenish from outside or a white paper test shows a greenish tint, you likely have Low-E glass.",

    }
  },
  {
    question: "If I have Low-E glass, can I save money by opting for clear glass?",
    answer: "Yes, choosing clear glass over Low-E can lower repair costs. While Low-E glass enhances energy efficiency by reducing heat loss and gain, clear glass is a budget-friendly alternative. Note that clear glass won't match Low-E visually, which may be noticeable depending on your preference. We're happy to provide both options to suit your needs.",

  {
    question: "What are muntins or grids?",
    answer: "Muntins, also called grids, are bars dividing a window into smaller panes. Found in multi-pane windows like double-hung or casement styles, they add a traditional look and structural support. They can also improve energy efficiency by creating a thermal barrier. We typically craft new grids for each glass package, reusing existing 1/2-inch grids if desired.",

  },
  {
    question: "What are colonial contour grids?",
    answer: "Colonial contour grids are decorative dividers mimicking traditional muntins in colonial-style homes. Made from plastic or composite materials, they're attached to the glass surface to create a multi-pane appearance on a single pane. We reuse your existing colonial grids in new glass packages for a seamless match, as styles vary by manufacturer.",

      alt: 'Video explaining tempered glass'
    }
  },
  {
    question: "What is laminated glass?",
    answer: "Laminated glass consists of two or more glass layers bonded with a plastic interlayer. Ideal for safety applications like skylights and car windows, it resists breakage, retains shards if broken, and blocks sound and UV rays effectively.",
    media: {
      type: 'video',
      url: 'https://youtu.be/j7ww47VTPk8',
      alt: 'Video explaining laminated glass'
    }
  },
  {
    question: "What is safety glass?",
    answer: "Safety glass, including tempered, laminated, and wired varieties, is designed to reduce injury risk. Treated for strength, it's used in high-risk areas like shower doors and storefronts, breaking into safer, rounded fragments if shattered."
  },
  {
    question: "What is annealed or clear glass?",
    answer: "Annealed glass is heated and slowly cooled to relieve stress, enhancing durability. Commonly used in windows, doors, and containers, it's a cost-effective option for repairs when safety glass isn't required."
  },
  {
    question: "Will new glass match my old glass?",
    answer: "New glass may not perfectly match your old glass due to variations in color and texture. However, our skilled professionals ensure a close fit and appearance. Exact matches are rare but possible with effort—we prioritize functionality and aesthetics in every repair."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it more efficient to replace my window or just the glass?",
    answer: "It depends. If your frame is in good condition, replacing the glass is often more efficient and costs less—usually under $300 for a double-hung window repair versus over $1,200 for a full replacement. For damaged frames, a new window may offer better long-term efficiency. Repair saves money today; replacement invests in tomorrow."
  },
  {
    question: "Are window salespeople commission-based?",
    answer: "Yes, many window salespeople earn commissions, incentivizing sales. This can lead to unbiased advice, but it's wise to research options independently. At The Window Hospital Inc., we focus on repair solutions to save you money, not push unnecessary replacements."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are replacement windows so expensive?",
    answer: "Replacement windows cost more due to labor, materials (e.g., wood, fiberglass), and customization. Unlike stock new-construction windows ($250+), replacements average over $1,200 each, including installation. Repairing glass at under $300 per window is a budget-friendly alternative."
  },
  {
    question: "Why does Low-E glass turn hazy?",
    answer: "Low-E coatings can oxidize over time from weather exposure, causing haziness and reduced efficiency. Repairing the glass restores performance without the expense of a full window replacement.",

    }
  },
  {
    question: "Why do my windows sweat on the inside?",
    answer: "Indoor sweating occurs due to high humidity, poor ventilation, or insulation issues. Reduce moisture with a dehumidifier or better airflow. Repairing seals or upgrading glass can also help, avoiding costly replacements."
  },
  {
    question: "What's an IGU?",
    answer: "An Insulated Glass Unit (IGU) features two or more panes separated by a gas-filled spacer, enhancing insulation. Repairing a failed IGU restores energy efficiency at a lower cost than replacing the entire window."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it worth it to replace a failed dual pane glass package?",
